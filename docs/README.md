The **Home Connect Local** allows users to integrate their home appliances supporting the  [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/global) standard for Bosch and Siemens using direct communication over the local network.

New here? Start with:

- **[Important terms](important-terms.md)**: terminology used throughout these docs
- **[Getting started](integration/getting-started.md)**: installation and supported devices

## The actual integration itself

- **[Supported functions](integration/supported-functions.md)**: full entity list by appliance type
- **[Use cases and automation examples](integration/use-cases-and-automation-examples.md)**
- **[Support & Troubleshooting](integration/support-and-troubleshooting.md)**: known limitations, requesting a feature, debug logging
- **[Other stuff](integration/other-stuff.md)**: profile export, data updates, actions, integration removal

## For contributors

- **[Contributing guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md)**: the general guidelines for contributing
- **[Adding a new entity](development/entity_descriptions.md)**: entity description fields by platform, dev-only config options
- **[US appliance notes](development/us_appliances.md)**: appliance-specific reverse-engineering details

- **[Secondary IoT Class](https://github.com/vemboy200/home-assistant.io/blob/iot-class-revamp-p3/source/_docs/iot_class.markdown) (unoffical thing):** Local Polling: The WiFi signal-strength diagnostic sensor is polled every hour
- **[Internet Requirement](https://github.com/vemboy200/home-assistant.io/blob/iot-class-revamp-p3/source/_docs/requires_internet.markdown) (unoffical thing):** Setup: obtaining your appliance's encryption keys via the [Home Connect Profile Downloader](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader) needs a one-time connection to the Home Connect cloud. Day-to-day operation after that is entirely local and works without an internet connection

## Maintiance note

This is a fork of [chris-mc1's repo](https://github.com/chris-mc1/homeconnect_local_hass) after they may have abandoned the integration.

I am maintaining this integration because

- I have some kind of weird obsession with smart appliances for some reason
- Because of [Jeff Geerling's frustration with his bosch 500 dishwasher](https://youtu.be/5M_hmwBBPnc?si=5VKBdr38sbwJL5Sg) which I'll summarize in the image below

Do you want to know the worst part though? My dishwasher, the Thermador DWHD660WFP has Home Connect and all functions ON THE PHYSICAL PANEL, aka I dont need to connect my dishwasher to my wifi to run a rinse cycle. I can but I don't need to. This is ridiculous BSH, you didn't need to remove the buttons and force people to use Home Connect.
